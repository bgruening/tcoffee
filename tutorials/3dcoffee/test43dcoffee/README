#preprocess your structures using t_coffee -other_pg extract_from_pdb, to extrat the chain and /or the domain that best corresponds to your sequences
# idealy, the sequence and the PDB should be perfect match, but if they are not the PDB induced sequence will be reconciliated with the sequence provided via -in
# template file declares which PDB corresponds to which structure
